I represent an Author within the context of academic publications.

It encapsulates the Author's unique identifier (id), name, and associations with their co-authors (coAuthors) and published works (publications). 
The instance variables 'id', 'name', 'coAuthors', and 'publications' are specific to each Author instance, allowing for the detailed representation of an individual's academic collaborations and contributions.

Additionally, the class variable 'authors' serves as a global dictionary, maintaining a comprehensive record of all Author instances. 
This facilitates easy access to and management of author information across the system, promoting efficient data retrieval and manipulation in relation to the entire author network within the academic context.
